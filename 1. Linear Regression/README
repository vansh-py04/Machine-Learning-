Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It's widely employed in various fields, including statistics, economics, engineering, and machine learning.

### Univariate Linear Regression:

In univariate linear regression, we have a single input feature (predictor variable) and a single output/target variable. The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line that describes the relationship between the input feature and the target variable. Mathematically, this relationship can be represented as:

\[ y = mx + b \]

Where:
- \( y \) is the target variable.
- \( x \) is the input feature.
- \( m \) is the slope of the line (the coefficient of the input feature).
- \( b \) is the intercept (the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \)).

The objective of univariate linear regression is to determine the values of \( m \) and \( b \) that minimize the difference between the predicted values of \( y \) and the actual values of \( y \), typically measured using a loss function such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

The optimal values of \( m \) and \( b \) can be found using various optimization techniques, with the most common being Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, where the parameters are chosen to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

### Multivariate Linear Regression:

Multivariate linear regression extends the concept of univariate linear regression to multiple input features. In this case, we have \( n \) input features (predictor variables) and a single output/target variable. The relationship between the input features and the target variable is represented by the equation:

\[ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n \]

Where:
- \( y \) is the target variable.
- \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) are the input features.
- \( b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \) are the coefficients (slopes) corresponding to each input feature.
- \( b_0 \) is the intercept.

The objective of multivariate linear regression is to determine the values of the coefficients that minimize the difference between the predicted values of \( y \) and the actual values of \( y \), again typically measured using a loss function like MSE or MAE.

Similar to univariate linear regression, the optimal values of the coefficients can be found using techniques like OLS, gradient descent, or matrix factorization methods.

Both univariate and multivariate linear regression are simple yet powerful techniques for modeling the relationship between input features and target variables when the relationship is approximately linear. They are widely used for tasks like prediction, forecasting, and understanding the relationship between variables in data analysis.
